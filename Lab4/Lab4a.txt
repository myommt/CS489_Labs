 What Is Spring?
Spring is a powerful, lightweight Java framework designed to simplify the development of enterprise applications. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure for:
- Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Transaction Management
- Web development (Spring MVC)
- Security (Spring Security)
- Data access (Spring JDBC, Spring Data JPA)
Spring is modular — you can use only the parts you need, making it flexible and scalable.

What Is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies application setup and development. It’s designed to help you:
- Create standalone, production-ready applications
- Avoid boilerplate configuration
- Use embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty) — no need to deploy WAR files
- Leverage auto-configuration based on classpath contents
- Use starter dependencies to streamline your pom.xml or build.gradle
Spring Boot is ideal for microservices, REST APIs, and cloud-native apps.

Relationship: Spring Platform vs Spring Boot
- The Spring Platform refers to the entire ecosystem of Spring projects — including Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Security, etc.
- Spring Boot is a project within the Spring Platform that makes using the Spring Framework easier and faster.
Think of Spring Boot as a convenient entry point into the broader Spring ecosystem.

Relationship: Spring Platform vs Spring Framework
- The Spring Framework is the core foundation of the Spring Platform.
- It provides the essential features like IoC, DI, AOP, and MVC.
- The Spring Platform includes the Spring Framework plus other projects like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data, etc.
So, Spring Framework is the heart, and the Spring Platform is the body.

What Is Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring?
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from an external source (the container), rather than creating them internally.
In Spring, DI is done via:
- Constructor Injection
- Setter Injection
- Field Injection (using @Autowired)

What Is Inversion of Control (IoC) and Its Role in Spring?
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is handed over to a container (like Spring), rather than being managed manually in code.
In Spring:
- The IoC container (e.g., ApplicationContext) creates and manages beans.
- It injects dependencies based on configuration (annotations, XML, or Java-based config).
- This promotes loose coupling, testability, and modularity.
IoC is the core philosophy behind Spring — it’s what makes DI possible.
